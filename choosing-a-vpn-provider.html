                <p class="mbr-text mbr-fonts-style display-7">Most VPN providers simply could not care less about your privacy, log all of your data/traffic, and spy on what you're doing 24/7 (cough cough HMA VPN cough cough). VPN's are very useful for a number of reasons such as; hiding your IP address from websites you visit, hide your web activity from your ISP, increase your online privacy &amp; anonymity. In this article, we'll list the two best VPN's inexpensive for privacy, anonymity, security, and flexibility.<br><br><u><strong>Mullvad VPN</strong><br></u>This VPN is a fast and inexpensive VPN starting at EUR €60/year with a serious focus on transparency and security. They have been in operation since 2009. Mullvad is based in Sweden and does not have a free trial. Mullvad has&nbsp;servers in 35 countries at the time of writing this page. Picking a VPN provider with a server nearest to you will reduce latency of the network traffic you send. This is because of a shorter route (less hops) to the destination. We also think it's better for the security of the VPN provider's private keys if they use&nbsp;dedicated servers, instead of cheaper shared solutions (with other customers) such as&nbsp;virtual private servers. Mullvad's VPN clients have been independently audited by Cure53 and Assured AB in a pentest report published at cure53.de. The security researchers concluded: "Cure53 and Assured AB are happy with the results of the audit and the software leaves an overall positive impression. With security dedication of the in-house team at the Mullvad VPN compound, the testers have no doubts about the project being on the right track from a security standpoint."<br><br>Mullvad also provides the source code for their desktop and mobile clients in their GitHub organization.&nbsp; While the Mullvad VPN Client does support OpenVPN, it also supports WireGuard. WireGuard is a protocol with theoretically better security and higher reliability, and we've determined that it is indeed more reliable, and is better than OpenVPN in almost every way. This VPN also supports the&nbsp;potential future of networking IPv6. Their network allows users to&nbsp;access services hosted on IPv6 as opposed to other providers who block IPv6 connections. The Mullvad VPN clients have a built-in killswitch to block internet connections outside of the VPN. They also are able to automatically start on boot. The Mullvad website is also accessible via Tor at&nbsp;o54hon2e2vj6c7m3aqqu6uyece65by3vgoxxhlqlsvkmacw6a7m7kiad.onion for privacy-focused users. In addition to accepting credit/debit cards and PayPal, Mullvad accepts Bitcoin,&nbsp;Bitcoin Cash, and&nbsp;cash/local currency as anonymous forms of payment. They also accept Swish and bank wire transfers. It's unfortunate that they do not accept Monero (more private than Bitcoin), however it's still good to hear that they accept some cryptocurrencies (BTC and BCH).<br><br><br><u><strong>ProtonVPN</strong><br></u>This VPN is a strong contender in the VPN space starting at $48/year, and they have been in operation since 2016. ProtonVPN is based in Switzerland and offers a limited free pricing tier, as well as premium options. They offer a further 14% discount for buying a 2 year subscription. ProtonVPN has&nbsp;servers in 44 countries at the time of writing this page. As mentioned, picking a VPN provider with a server nearest to you will reduce latency of the network traffic you send. This is because of a shorter route (less hops) to the destination. We also think it's better for the security of the VPN provider's private keys if they use dedicated servers, instead of cheaper shared solutions (with other customers) such as virtual private servers.<br>As of January 2020 ProtonVPN has undergone an independent audit by SEC Consult. SEC Consult found some medium and low risk vulnerabilities in ProtonVPN's Windows, Android, and iOS applications, all of which were "properly fixed" by ProtonVPN before the reports were published. None of the issues identified would have provided an attacker remote access to a user's device or traffic. You can view individual reports for each platform at&nbsp;protonvpn.com. Like Mullvad, ProtonVPN provides the source code for their desktop and mobile clients in their&nbsp;GitHub organization. ProtonVPN does technically accept Bitcoin payments; however, you either need to have an existing account, or contact their support team in advance to register with Bitcoin. Otherwise, you cannot pay with Bitcoin or any other cryptocurrency by default. ProtonVPN does not currently support remote port forwarding, while Mullvad does. This can interfere with some applications such as P2P Torrent Clients.<br>Lastly, like Mullvad, The ProtonVPN clients have a built-in killswitch to block internet connections outside of the VPN. They also are able to automatically start on boot. ProtonVPN also offers "Tor" servers allowing you to easily connect to onion sites, but we strongly recommend using the official Tor Browser for this purpose.<br><br><br><u><strong>Conclusion</strong><br></u>Though we have listed the two best VPN providers for privacy and anonymity above, you should carefully review our comments and determine which one would work out best for you. Both of these VPN providers are excellent, will help you take back your online privacy, and will prevent your ISP from snooping around seeing the sites you visit. If you are on an extremely tight budget, we recommend trying our 2nd recommendation above (ProtonVPN). You can even try their free plan, though we recommend using the free plan as a free trial, and if you like it, you can upgrade to get access to their Secure Core feature and dozens of more servers with a much smaller load. We hope this article helped you choose a privacy-focused VPN provider!<strong><br></strong></p>
