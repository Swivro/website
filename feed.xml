                <p>Though Windows 11 was recently publicly released by Microsoft, just the other month, most people still use Windows 10. Microsoft introduced a lot of new features in Windows 10 such as Cortana. However, most of them are violating your privacy. Windows 11 isn't any better privacy-wise.</p>

<p>W10Privacy is a tool that attempts to disable all major tracking features in Windows 10 and 11. Check it out <a href="https://www.winprivacy.de/english-home/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>.</p>
<p>Thehackernews.com reports that when a user left Microsoft Windows idle for about 8 hours, the computer had tried attempting well over 5,000 mysterious connections to 93 unique IP addresses, with almost 90% of those mysterious connections leading to IP addresses owned by Microsoft. Microsoft claims that all of this data sent is encrypted, and that no personal information is sent to them, so chances are, they are probably seeing what apps you're using, how much time you spend on them, etc. In Microsoft's official article stating that Windows 11 was being released on Oct. 5th, the word "privacy" did not appear once, and they did not even remotely mention anything user privacy related. Microsoft Windows is an OS that does not care one bit about user privacy and is solely focused on making Microsoft money.</p>
<p>Linux is simply the best option. Don't even think of trying Apple's overpriced ugly garbage, because with the new child-abuse scanning feature your privacy is non-existent. There are thousands of Linux distros available on the internet, for you to use. To help you choose a Linux distro, we'll list some of the most popular, simple, and privacy-respecting ones below.</p>
<figure class="post__image"><img loading="lazy"  src="https://swivro.net/media/posts/46/1024px-Desktop_Ubuntu_20.04.png" sizes="(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 100vw" srcset="https://swivro.net/media/posts/46/responsive/1024px-Desktop_Ubuntu_20.04-xs.png 300w ,https://swivro.net/media/posts/46/responsive/1024px-Desktop_Ubuntu_20.04-sm.png 480w ,https://swivro.net/media/posts/46/responsive/1024px-Desktop_Ubuntu_20.04-md.png 768w"  alt="" width="1024" height="576"></figure>
<h2>Ubuntu</h2>
<p>Ubuntu is <strong>an open-source operating system (OS) based on the Debian GNU/Linux distribution</strong>. Ubuntu incorporates all the features of a Unix OS with an added customizable GUI, which makes it popular in universities and research organizations. Fun fact: Ubuntu is an African word that literally means "humanity to others." Ubuntu is incredibly easy to use, has an elegant interface, and is our favorite. I am currently typing these words on Ubuntu. At the time of writing, the latest LTS (long-term-support) version of Ubuntu is 20.04. <a href="https://ubuntu.com/download/desktop" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Check out Ubuntu Desktop here</a>.</p>

<h2>Zorin OS</h2>
<p>Zorin OS is a personal computer operating system designed and promoted for users new to Linux-based computers. One of its built-in features lets users change the interface to resemble those of Microsoft Windows or macOS. In other words, if you're used to Windows, you can customize the Zorin OS layout to be more similar to the Windows layout (as seen in the screenshot above), or you can customize it to look more similar to the macOS layout. We like Ubuntu the best, but you may like Zorin OS better. Zorin OS is free, but offers a "Pro" version with more features. <a href="https://zorin.com/os/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Check out Zorin OS here</a>.</p>

<h2>DraugerOS</h2>
<p>Drauger OS is a Linux desktop gaming operating system. It aims to provide a platform for gamers to use where they can get great performance without sacrificing their security. Furthermore, it aims to make it easy for anyone to game, whether they use a keyboard and mouse, or some sort of controller. DraugerOS is based off of Ubuntu LTS releases and is stable, secure, and gets updates thanks to the Ubuntu repositories for 5 years (even if a given Drauger OS release is not supported for the full 5 years by Drauger OS Development itself). If you're a gamer, and you're currently using Microsoft Windows, but want some more privacy and better security, we think you'll enjoy DraugerOS. <a href="https://draugeros.org/go/download-old/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Check out DraugerOS here</a>.</p>
<p>Each distro that we recommend above is unique in it's own way. Some lack features when compared to others, and some have more features. It all comes down to your personal preference. We suggest carefully reviewing the info provided above about each Linux distro, and from that, determine which distro you think would be best for you. You can also try each distro individually, and keep the one you like the most. Lastly, you can go to YouTube (or invidious if you're privacy-focused) and search for reviews on all of the distros listed above. Thanks for reading, and we hope this article helped you choose a Linux distro &amp; move away from Microsoft's nasty OS!</p>

That is, right after Google, the worst DNS resolver service in the world in terms of privacy. DNS-over-HTTPS, DNS-over-TLS, and DNSCrypt resolvers will not make you anonymous. Using Anonymized DNSCrypt hides <i>only</i> your DNS traffic from your Internet Service Provider, so the DNS provider can still see what's going on. However, using any of these protocols will prevent DNS hijacking, and make your DNS requests harder for third parties to eavesdrop on and tamper with.

<p class="card-text"><strong>VeraCrypt</strong> is a source-available freeware utility used for on-the-fly encryption. It can create a virtual encrypted disk within a file or encrypt a partition or the entire storage device with pre-boot authentication. VeraCrypt is a fork of the discontinued TrueCrypt project. It was initially released on June 22, 2013. According to its developers, security improvements have been implemented and issues raised by the initial TrueCrypt code audit have been addressed. <a href="https://veracrypt.fr/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Check out VeraCrypt</a>.</p>
<p class="card-text"><strong>GnuPG</strong> is a GPL-licensed alternative to the PGP suite of cryptographic software. GnuPG is compliant with RFC 4880, which is the current IETF standards track specification of OpenPGP. Current versions of PGP (and Veridis' Filecrypt) are interoperable with GnuPG and other OpenPGP-compliant systems. GnuPG is a part of the Free Software Foundation's GNU software project, and has received major funding from the German government. <a href="https://gnupg.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Check out GnuPG</a>.</p>

<p><strong><a href="https://protonmail.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ProtonMail.com</a></strong> is an email service with a focus on privacy, encryption, security, and ease of use. They have been in operation since <strong>2013</strong>. ProtonMail is based in Genève, Switzerland. Accounts start with 500 MB storage with their <strong>free</strong> plan. ProtonMail is also accessible via Tor (the ProtonMail onionsite) for increased anonymity. ProtonMail Free accounts have some limitations and do not allow the use of the <a href="https://protonmail.com/bridge" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ProtonMail Bridge</a>, which is required to use a <a href="https://privacy.promo/software/email" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">recommended email client</a> (e.g. Thunderbird) or to search email by body text. Paid accounts are very inexpensive, and are available starting at <strong>€48/year</strong> which include features like ProtonMail Bridge, additional storage, custom domain support, and more. The webmail and mobile apps can only search <code>To:</code>, <code>From:</code>, <code>Date:</code> and <code>Subject:</code> (this is likely to change when <a href="https://reddit.com/comments/cqwk2a/comment/ex21b4e" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">v4.0</a> of ProtonMail is released). ProtonMail accepts Bitcoin in addition to accepting credit/debit cards and PayPal. You should have at least one of these payment methods. Bitcoin is the most anonymous in most cases. ProtonMail has <a href="https://protonmail.com/blog/zero-access-encryption" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">zero access encryption at rest</a> for your emails, <a href="https://protonmail.com/blog/encrypted-contacts-manager" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">address book contacts</a>, and <a href="https://protonmail.com/blog/protoncalendar-security-model" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">calendars</a>. This means the messages and other data stored in your account are only readable by you. ProtonMail has <a href="https://protonmail.com/support/knowledge-base/how-to-use-pgp" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">integrated OpenPGP encryption</a> in their webmail. Emails to other ProtonMail users are encrypted automatically, and encryption to non-ProtonMail users with an OpenPGP key can be enabled easily in your account settings. They also allow you to <a href="https://protonmail.com/support/knowledge-base/encrypt-for-outside-users">encrypt messages to non-ProtonMail users</a> without the need for them to sign up for a ProtonMail account or use software like OpenPGP. ProtonMail also supports the discovery of public keys via HTTP from their <a href="https://wiki.gnupg.org/WKD" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Web Key Directory (WKD)</a>. This allows users outside of ProtonMail to find the OpenPGP keys of ProtonMail users easily, for cross-provider E2EE.</p>
<p><strong><a href="https://mailbox.org/">Mailbox.org</a></strong> is an email service with a focus on being secure, ad-free, and privately powered by 100% eco-friendly energy. They have been in operation since <strong>2014</strong>. Mailbox.org is based in Berlin, Germany. Accounts start with 2 GB of storage, which can be upgraded as needed. Mailbox.org doesn't accept Bitcoin or any other cryptocurrencies as a result of their payment processor BitPay suspending operations in Germany. However, they do accept Cash by mail, cash payment to bank account, bank transfer, credit card, PayPal and couple of German-specific processors: paydirekt and Sofortüberweisung. Due to the fact that they don't accept any cryptocurrencies, this reduces your anonymity &amp; privacy. Typically, you want to provide a company with as little personal info as possible. Mailbox.org allows for encryption of incoming mail using their <a href="https://kb.mailbox.org/display/MBOKBEN/The+Encrypted+Mailbox" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">encrypted mailbox</a>. New messages that you receive will then be immediately encrypted with your public key. Mailbox.org has <a href="https://kb.mailbox.org/display/MBOKBEN/Send+encrypted+e-mails+with+Guard" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">integrated encryption</a> in their webmail, which simplifies sending messages to users with public OpenPGP keys. They also allow <a href="https://kb.mailbox.org/display/MBOKBEN/My+recipient+does+not+use+PGP" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">remote recipients to decrypt an email</a> on Mailbox.org's servers. This feature is useful when the remote recipient does not have OpenPGP and cannot decrypt a copy of the email in their own mailbox. Mailbox.org also supports the discovery of public keys via HTTP from their <a href="https://wiki.gnupg.org/WKD" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Web Key Directory (WKD)</a>. This allows users outside of Mailbox.org to find the OpenPGP keys of Mailbox.org users easily, for cross-provider E2EE.</p>
<p><strong><a href="https://disroot.org/en/services/email">Disroot</a></strong> offers email amongst <a href="https://disroot.org/en/#services">other services</a>. The service is maintained by volunteers and its community. They have been in operation since <strong>2015</strong>. Disroot is based in Amsterdam. Disroot is free and uses open source software such as Rainloop to provide service. Users support the service through donations and buying extra storage. The mailbox limit is 1 GB, but extra storage can be purchased 0.15€ per GB per month paid yearly. Disroot accepts Bitcoin and Faircoin as payment methods. They also accept PayPal, direct bank deposit, and Patreon payments. Disroot is a not-for-profit organization that also accepts donations through Liberapay, Flattr, and Monero, but these payment methods cannot be used to purchase services. Disroot uses full disk encryption on their email servers. However, it doesn't appear to be "zero access", meaning it is technically possible for them to decrypt the data they have. Disroot allows for encrypted emails to be sent from their webmail application using OpenPGP. However, Disroot has not integrated a <a href="https://wiki.gnupg.org/WKD">Web Key Directory (WKD)</a> for users on their platform.</p>
<p><strong><a href="https://tutanota.com/">Tutanota.com</a></strong> is an email service with a focus on security and privacy through the use of encryption. Tutanota has been in operation since <strong>2011</strong> and is based in Hanover, Germany. Accounts start with 1GB storage with their free plan. <span style="color: #e03e2d;">Tutanota accepts only credit cards and PayPal.</span> This can definitely reduce your anonymity and privacy. Tutanota has <a href="https://tutanota.com/faq#what-encrypted" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">zero access encryption at rest</a> for your emails, <a href="https://tutanota.com/faq#encrypted-address-book" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">address book contacts</a>, and <a href="https://tutanota.com/faq#calendar" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">calendars</a>. This means the messages and other data stored in your account are only readable by you, and Tutanota is unable to see your data. Tutanota <a href="https://www.tutanota.com/faq/#pgp" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">does not use OpenPGP</a>. Tutanota users can only receive encrypted emails when external users send them through a <a href="https://www.tutanota.com/howto/#encrypted-email-external" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">temporary Tutanota mailbox</a>. Tutanota <a href="https://github.com/tutao/tutanota/issues/198">does have plans</a> to support <a href="https://autocrypt.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">AutoCrypt</a>. This would allow for external users to send encrypted emails to Tutanota users as long as their email client supports the AutoCrypt headers.</p>
<p>You should carefully review the descriptions that we have provided of the 4 best email providers listed above, and use that info to determine which email provider you think would work best for you. Each one has it's own unique features, but only one of them will fit your needs the best. We hope you found this article helpful, have a nice day!</p>

<p class="lead">It's time to finally stop using Google, Bing, and Ecosia, because they <strong>all</strong> unethically track you and store sensitive information from you without consent. Discover search engines that doesn't track your search queries or display personalized ads based on your search history. Here are our favorites, listed below:</p>
<p class="card-text"><strong>Searx</strong> is an <a href="https://github.com/asciimoo/searx" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">open-source</a>, self-hostable, metasearch engine, aggregating the results of other search engines while not storing information about its users. Searx is kind enough to provide a <a href="https://searx.space/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">list of public instances</a>, or you can try out the <a href="https://searx.nixnet.services/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">NixNet Public instance.</a></p>
<p class="card-text"><strong>DuckDuckGo</strong> is a "search engine that doesn't track you." Some of DuckDuckGo's code is free software hosted at GitHub, but the DuckDuckGo core is unfortunatley proprietary, meaning we will not be able to see exactly what's going on. <a href="https://swivro.net/why-you-should-avoid-us-and-uk-services/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The company is based in the USA.</a></p>
<p class="card-text"><strong>Qwant </strong>is a search engine with its philosophy based on two principles: no user tracking and no filter bubble.  <a href="https://swivro.net/why-you-should-avoid-us-and-uk-services/">The company is based in France.</a> While the complete source code of Qwant is not publicly accessible, it is believed that Qwant does not unethically track you, does not sell your data, and does not collect and save your search queries for research purposes.</p>
<p class="card-text"><strong>Startpage</strong> is a search engine that displays search results from Google with complete privacy protection against Google's nasty tracking software. Startpage BV is a Netherlands-based company that has been dedicated to privacy-respecting web search since 2006. While the complete source code to Startpage is not publicly accessible, it is believed that Startpage does not unethically track you, doesn't sell your data, and does not collect and save your search queries for research purposes. <span style="color: #e03e2d;"><strong>Warning</strong>: Startpage was recently acquired by System1, a US-based analytics company.</span></p>
<p><strong>Mojeek </strong>is a search engine that you can really trust, based in the United Kingdom. The search results which are provided by Mojeek come from its own index of web pages (unlike Startpage and DuckDuckGo), created by crawling the web. Mojeek is completely open source, so you can see everything that is going on when you use Mojeek, by looking at it's source code. Mojeek is also the first search engine to have a policy of not tracking its users.</p>
<p>All of these search engines recommended above are unique in their own way. We suggest that you carefully reviewing the info we provided about them, and try each of them out individually to determine which one is best for you. Thanks for reading!</p>

                    <img src="https://swivro.net/media/posts/41/telephone-586266_1920.jpg" alt="" />
                <p>If you are currently using an Instant Messenger like Telegram, LINE, Viber, WhatsApp, or plain SMS on your mobile device, we highly suggest picking an alternative, which is what this post is all about.</p>
<p>We only recommend instant messengers that utilize end-to-end encryption (E2EE), as E2EE encrypts all messages, voice, video, etc, before they are sent from your device to the recipient. E2EE will also protect the confidentiality and authenticity of the transmission as it passes through any part of the network. Any instant messengers we recommend below and completely free and are open source. </p>
<p><a href="https://signal.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Signal</a> is a mobile and desktop app developed by Signal Messenger LLC, which is very similar to Telegram but features full E2EE. The app provides instant messaging, as well as voice and video calling. All communications through Signal are end-to-end encrypted unless you choose to send a message as SMS. The Signal Protocol was also <a href="https://eprint.iacr.org/2016/1013.pdf">independently audited</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Signal Benefits:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Cross-platform, supporting Desktop and Mobile.</li>
<li>New features and changes can be implemented more quickly.</li>
<li>Easier to get started with and to find contacts.</li>
<li>Recommended by Elon Musk :)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Signal Downsides:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Requires a phone number</li>
<li>Poor/No documentation for 3rd party developers</li>
<li>The ownership, privacy policy, and operations of the service can change easily when a single entity controls it, potentially compromising the service later on.</li>
<li>Centralized services could be more susceptible to legislation requiring backdoor access.</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<p><a href="https://element.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Element</a> is the reference client for the <a href="https://matrix.org/docs/guides/introduction" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Matrix</a> network. The <a href="https://matrix.org/docs/spec" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Matrix open standard</a> is an open-source standard for secure (<a href="https://matrix.org/blog/2016/11/21/matrixs-olm-end-to-end-encryption-security-assessment-released-and-implemented-cross-platform-on-riot-at-last" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">audit</a>), federated, real-time communication. Element/Matrix utilizes end-to-end encryption, does not require a phone number, can be used in a web browser, and is completely free, having a similar feel to the popular Discord App. Federated (aka decentralized) messengers use multiple, independent servers that are able to talk to each other (email is one example of a federated service). Federation allows system administrators to control their own server and still be a part of the larger communications network. If you're a high threat level, we suggest using Element over the Tor Network in conjunction with a VPN. We suggest to either using the Public Matrix Server on Element, or create your own for maximum privacy.</p>
<p><strong>Element Benefits:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Allows for greater control over your own data when running your own server.</li>
<li>Often allows for third party clients which can provide a more native, customized, simpler, or more accessible experience.</li>
<li>Allows you to choose who to trust your data with by choosing between multiple "public" matrix servers. We highly suggest running your own private server.</li>
<li>Generally a less juicy target for governments wanting backdoor access to everything as the trust is decentralized.</li>
<li>Server software can be verified that it matches public source code, assuming you have access to the server or you trust the person who does (ex: a family member or friend)</li>
<li>Third-party developers can contribute code and add new features, instead of waiting for a private development team to do so.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Element Downsides:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Adding new features is more complex, because these features need to be standardized and tested to ensure they work with all servers on the network.</li>
<li>Some metadata may be available (e.g., information like "who is talking to whom," but not actual message content if E2EE is used).</li>
<li>Federated servers generally require trusting your server's administrator. They may be a hobbyist or otherwise not a "security professional," and may not serve standard documents like a privacy policy or terms of service detailing how your data is utilized.</li>
<li>Server administrators sometimes choose to block other servers, which are a source of unmoderated abuse or break general rules of accepted behavior. This will hinder your ability to communicate with users on those servers.</li>
</ul>
<p>You should choose which messenger you think is a better option for you. If you're not a high threat level, and you're just looking for a more private experience when talking your friends, colleagues, or family members (whether that is via messaging, voice, or video), we suggest giving Signal a try. If you're maybe a higher threat level, want maximum anonymity, or want to share as little information as possible, we suggest going with Element/Matrix. We hope this article helped you pick a privacy-focused messenger!</p>

                <p>The UKUSA Agreement is an agreement between the United Kingdom, United States, Australia, Canada, and New Zealand to cooperatively collect, analyze, and share intelligence. Members of this group, known as the <a href="https://www.giswatch.org/en/communications-surveillance/unmasking-five-eyes-global-surveillance-practices" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Five Eyes</a>, focus on gathering and analyzing intelligence from different parts of the world. While Five Eyes countries have agreed to <a href="https://www.pbs.org/newshour/world/an-exclusive-club-the-five-countries-that-dont-spy-on-each-other" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">not spy on each other</a> as adversaries, leaks by Snowden have revealed that some Five Eyes members monitor each other's citizens and <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2013/jun/21/gchq-cables-secret-world-communications-nsa" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">share intelligence</a> to <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2013/jun/10/nsa-offers-intelligence-british-counterparts-blunkett" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">avoid breaking domestic laws</a> that prohibit them from spying on their own citizens. The Five Eyes alliance also cooperates with groups of third-party countries to share intelligence (forming the Nine Eyes and Fourteen Eyes); however, Five Eyes and third-party countries can and do spy on each other.</p>

<h2 id="kdl" class="anchor">Key Disclosure Law</h2>
<p>Who is required to hand over the encryption keys to authorities? Mandatory <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Key_disclosure_law" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">key disclosure laws</a> require individuals to turn over encryption keys to law enforcement conducting a criminal investigation. How these laws are implemented (who may be legally compelled to assist) vary from nation to nation, but a warrant is generally required. Defenses against key disclosure laws include steganography and encrypting data in a way that provides plausible deniability. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steganography" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Steganography</a> involves hiding sensitive information (which may be encrypted) inside of ordinary data (for example, encrypting an image file and then hiding it in an audio file). With plausible deniability, data is encrypted in a way that prevents an adversary from being able to prove that the information they are after exists (for example, one password may decrypt benign data and another password, used on the same file, could decrypt sensitive data).</p>
<h4>Key disclosure laws apply:</h4>
<ol>
<li>Antigua &amp; Barbuda</li>
<li>Australia</li>
<li>France</li>
<li>India</li>
<li>Ireland</li>
<li>Norway</li>
<li>Russia</li>
<li>South Africa</li>
<li>United Kingdom</li>

<h4>Key disclosure laws <em>may </em>apply:</h4>

<li>Estonia</li>
<li>Finland *</li>
<li>New Zealand (unclear)</li>
<li>The Netherlands *</li>
<li>United States</li>

<li>Switzerland</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="usa" class="anchor">Why is it not recommended to choose a US-based service?</h2>
<p>Services based in the United States are not recommended because of the country's surveillance programs and use of <a href="https://www.eff.org/issues/national-security-letters/faq" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">National Security Letters</a> (NSLs) with accompanying gag orders, which forbid the recipient from talking about the request (EX: informing their users that they received a subpoena). This combination allows the government to <a href="https://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2013/08/more_on_the_nsa.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">secretly force</a> companies to grant complete access to customer data and transform the service into a tool of mass surveillance. A perfect example of this is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lavabit#Suspension_and_gag_order" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Lavabit</a> – a secure email service created by Ladar Levison. The FBI <a href="https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/nzz888/lavabit-founder-ladar-levison-discusses-his-federal-battle-for-privacy" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">requested</a> Snowden's records after finding out that he used the service. Since Lavabit did not keep logs and email content was stored encrypted, the FBI served a subpoena (with a gag order) for the service's SSL keys. Having the SSL keys would allow them to access communications (both metadata and unencrypted content) in real time for all of Lavabit's customers, not just Snowden's. Levison turned over the SSL keys and <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/may/20/why-did-lavabit-shut-down-snowden-email" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">shut down</a> the service at the same time. The US government then <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/id/100962389" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">threatened Levison with arrest</a>, saying that shutting down the service was a violation of the court order. Avoid US services at all costs.</p>

                <p>Most VPN providers simply could not care less about your privacy, log all of your data/traffic, and spy on what you're doing 24/7 (<em>cough cough</em> HMA VPN <em>cough cough</em>). VPN's are very useful for a number of reasons such as; hiding your IP address from websites you visit, hide your web activity from your ISP, increase your online privacy &amp; anonymity. In this article, we'll list the two best VPN's inexpensive for privacy, anonymity, security, and flexibility.</p>
<h2>Option 1: Mullvad</h2>
<p><strong><a href="https://mullvad.net/">Mullvad.net</a> </strong>is a fast and inexpensive VPN starting at EUR €60/year with a serious focus on transparency and security. They have been in operation since <strong>2009</strong>. Mullvad is based in Sweden and does not have a free trial. Mullvad has <a href="https://mullvad.net/en/servers/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">servers in 35 countries</a> at the time of writing this page. Picking a VPN provider with a server nearest to you will reduce latency of the network traffic you send. This is because of a shorter route (less hops) to the destination. We also think it's better for the security of the VPN provider's private keys if they use <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dedicated_hosting_service" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">dedicated servers</a>, instead of cheaper shared solutions (with other customers) such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_private_server" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">virtual private servers</a>. Mullvad's VPN clients have been independently audited by Cure53 and Assured AB in a pentest report <a href="https://cure53.de/pentest-report_mullvad_v2.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">published at cure53.de</a>. The security researchers concluded:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p class="mb-0">...Cure53 and Assured AB are happy with the results of the audit and the software leaves an overall positive impression. With security dedication of the in-house team at the Mullvad VPN compound, the testers have no doubts about the project being on the right track from a security standpoint.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Mullvad also provides the source code for their desktop and mobile clients in their <a href="https://github.com/mullvad/mullvadvpn-app" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">GitHub organization</a>.  While the Mullvad VPN Client does support OpenVPN, it also supports WireGuard. WireGuard is a protocol with theoretically better security and higher reliability, and we've determined that it is indeed more reliable, and is better than OpenVPN in almost every way. This VPN also supports the <em>potential</em> future of networking <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPv6" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">IPv6</a>. Their network allows users to <a href="https://mullvad.net/en/blog/2014/9/15/ipv6-support/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">access services hosted on IPv6</a> as opposed to other providers who block IPv6 connections. <span style="color: var(--text-editor-body-color); font-family: var(--font-base); font-size: inherit; font-weight: var(--font-weight-normal);">The Mullvad VPN clients have a built-in killswitch to block internet connections outside of the VPN. They also are able to automatically start on boot. The Mullvad website is also accessible via Tor at </span><a href="https://privacy.promo/providers/vpn/o54hon2e2vj6c7m3aqqu6uyece65by3vgoxxhlqlsvkmacw6a7m7kiad.onion" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">o54hon2e2vj6c7m3aqqu6uyece65by3vgoxxhlqlsvkmacw6a7m7kiad.onion</a><span style="color: var(--text-editor-body-color); font-family: var(--font-base); font-size: inherit; font-weight: var(--font-weight-normal);"> for privacy-focused users. </span><span style="color: var(--text-editor-body-color); font-family: var(--font-base); font-size: inherit; font-weight: var(--font-weight-normal);">I</span><span style="color: var(--text-editor-body-color); font-family: var(--font-base); font-size: inherit; font-weight: var(--font-weight-normal);">n addition to accepting credit/debit cards and PayPal, Mullvad accepts </span><strong style="color: var(--text-editor-body-color); font-family: var(--font-base); font-size: inherit;">Bitcoin</strong><span style="color: var(--text-editor-body-color); font-family: var(--font-base); font-size: inherit; font-weight: var(--font-weight-normal);">, </span><strong style="color: var(--text-editor-body-color); font-family: var(--font-base); font-size: inherit;">Bitcoin Cash</strong><span style="color: var(--text-editor-body-color); font-family: var(--font-base); font-size: inherit; font-weight: var(--font-weight-normal);">, and </span><strong style="color: var(--text-editor-body-color); font-family: var(--font-base); font-size: inherit;">cash/local currency</strong><span style="color: var(--text-editor-body-color); font-family: var(--font-base); font-size: inherit; font-weight: var(--font-weight-normal);"> as anonymous forms of payment. They also accept Swish and bank wire transfers. It's unfortunate that they do not accept Monero (more private than Bitcoin), however it's still good to hear that they accept some cryptocurrencies (BTC and BCH).</span></p>
<p> </p>
<h2>Option 2: ProtonVPN</h2>
<p><strong><a href="https://protonvpn.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ProtonVPN.com</a></strong> is a strong contender in the VPN space starting at $48/year, and they have been in operation since <strong>2016</strong>. ProtonVPN is based in Switzerland and offers a limited free pricing tier, as well as premium options. They offer a further 14% discount for buying a 2 year subscription. ProtonVPN has <a href="https://protonvpn.com/vpn-servers" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">servers in 44 countries</a> at the time of writing this page. As mentioned, picking a VPN provider with a server nearest to you will reduce latency of the network traffic you send. This is because of a shorter route (less hops) to the destination. We also think it's better for the security of the VPN provider's private keys if they use dedicated servers, instead of cheaper shared solutions (with other customers) such as virtual private servers. As of January 2020 ProtonVPN has undergone an independent audit by SEC Consult. SEC Consult found some medium and low risk vulnerabilities in ProtonVPN's Windows, Android, and iOS applications, all of which were "properly fixed" by ProtonVPN before the reports were published. None of the issues identified would have provided an attacker remote access to a user's device or traffic. You can view individual reports for each platform at <a href="https://protonvpn.com/blog/open-source/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">protonvpn.com</a>. Like Mullvad, ProtonVPN provides the source code for their desktop and mobile clients in their <a href="https://github.com/ProtonVPN" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">GitHub organization</a>. ProtonVPN does technically accept Bitcoin payments; however, you either need to have an existing account, or contact their support team in advance to register with Bitcoin. Otherwise, you cannot pay with Bitcoin or any other cryptocurrency by default. ProtonVPN does not currently support remote port forwarding, while Mullvad does. This can interfere with some applications such as P2P Torrent Clients. </p>
<p>Lastly, like Mullvad, <span style="color: var(--text-editor-body-color); font-family: var(--font-base); font-size: inherit; font-weight: var(--font-weight-normal);">The ProtonVPN clients have a built-in killswitch to block internet connections outside of the VPN. They also are able to automatically start on boot. ProtonVPN also offers "Tor" servers allowing you to easily connect to onion sites, but we strongly recommend using </span><a href="https://www.torproject.org/" style="font-family: var(--font-base); font-size: inherit; font-weight: var(--font-weight-normal);">the official Tor Browser</a><span style="color: var(--text-editor-body-color); font-family: var(--font-base); font-size: inherit; font-weight: var(--font-weight-normal);"> for this purpose.</span></p>
<p> </p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>Though we have listed the two best VPN providers for privacy and anonymity above, you should carefully review our comments and determine which one would work out best for you. Both of these VPN providers are excellent, will help you take back your online privacy, and will prevent your ISP from snooping around seeing the sites you visit. If you are on an extremely tight budget, we recommend trying our 2nd recommendation above (ProtonVPN). You can even try their free plan, though we recommend using the free plan as a free trial, and if you like it, you can upgrade to get access to their Secure Core feature and dozens of more servers with a much smaller load. We hope this article helped you choose a privacy-focused VPN provider!</p>

                <p>A DDoS Attack (short for distributed denial of service) is a type of cyberattack which typically targets a website. During a DDoS attack, a large amount of requests are sent to the target website, in an attempt to consume all of the server's resources (RAM, CPU, etc), therefore making the website inaccessible to the public. Below, we'll show you the most common types of DDoS Attacks, how they work, and how to mitigate them.</p>
<h2><strong>Layer 7 DDoS</strong></h2>
<p>A layer 7 DDoS is a type of DDoS attack that sends HTTP traffic to a website in order to consume resources and hamper a website's ability to deliver content to visitors. An HTTP flood attack utilizes what appear to be legitimate HTTP requests to attack a website. We will recommend three different services in order to mitigate such attacks, being DDoS-Guard, BotGuard, and Cloudflare. DDoS-Guard and Cloudflare Pro are most effective, but BotGuard will certainly mitigate medium sized attacks. Alternatively, if you wish to manually configure software on your hosting server (which is less limited compared to cloud services like Cloudflare), we recommend trying Fail2ban, Modsecurity, or Bunkerized Nginx Webserver (which includes Fail2ban and Modsecurity).</p>
<p> </p>
<h2><strong>Layer 3/4 DDoS</strong></h2>
<p>A Layer 4 DDoS attack is often referred to as a SYN flood. A TCP connection is established in what is known as a 3-way handshake. The client sends a SYN packet to the target server, the server responds with a SYN ACK, and the client responds to that with an ACK. After the three-way handshake is complete, the TCP connection is considered established. Attackers can send SYN Floods in an attempt to stop one's network from functioning properly. Layer 3 attacks often utilize the ICMP protocol which can be stopped by disabling ICMP. Layer 4 attacks are often easy to mitigate as long as you choose the right server provider. OVH provides DDoS Protection with all of their servers and has a network capacity of over 11 TBPS.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>DDoS Attacks are extremely harmful to websites, and are of course illegal. We hope you learned something useful from this post!</p>

                <p>Publicly disclosing your email address is dangerous for many reasons with the biggest reason being; by disclosing your email address, it shows what email provider you use. For example, if my Email is example@gmail.com, and I publicly disclose that email, a hacker can go to gmail.com and try to hack into my account by cracking my password or via social engineering. Your email can also end up in a bad place (ex: dangerous dark web forums), which can lead to bad things. Below, we'll be suggesting two services which allow you to create email aliases, so you can still receive emails on your email address, but your real email address won't be public.</p>
<h2><strong>Option 1: AnonAddy</strong></h2>
<div>AnonAddy lets you create your own email aliases to mask your real email address. If someone asks for your email address and you don't fully trust them, you can login to your AnonAddy account, and create a new email alias that forwards all mail sent to the email alias to your real email address. If my email alias is bob@anonaddy.me and my real email address is bobsmith@gmail.com, all mail sent to bob@anonaddy.me will be anonymously forwarded to bobsmith@gmail.com.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>TL;DR AnonAddy let's you receive emails without exposing your real email, by using email aliases. Get started for free at their website <a href="https://anonaddy.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">anonaddy.com</a></div>
<div> </div>
<h2><strong>Option 2: SimpleLogin</strong></h2>
<p>As the name suggests, SimpleLogin is very simple. SimpleLogin essentially does the same thing as AnonAddy, but as mentioned, is more simple and straight to the point. SimpleLogin is 100% open source and uses PGP Encryption (as does AnonAddy). Lastly, SimpleLogin appears to have better pricing when compared to AnonAddy, but they are both good solutions, you'll just have to choose which one you like more.<br><br>TL;DR SimpleLogin does the same thing as AnonAddy but is simpler and has better pricing.
