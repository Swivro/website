                <p>A DDoS Attack (short for distributed denial of service) is a type of cyberattack which typically targets a website. During a DDoS attack, a large amount of requests are sent to the target website, in an attempt to consume all of the server's resources (RAM, CPU, etc), therefore making the website inaccessible to the public. Below, we'll show you the most common types of DDoS Attacks, how they work, and how to mitigate them.</p>
<h2><strong>Layer 7 DDoS</strong></h2>
<p>A layer 7 DDoS is a type of DDoS attack that sends HTTP traffic to a website in order to consume resources and hamper a website's ability to deliver content to visitors. An HTTP flood attack utilizes what appear to be legitimate HTTP requests to attack a website. We will recommend three different services in order to mitigate such attacks, being DDoS-Guard, BotGuard, and Cloudflare. DDoS-Guard and Cloudflare Pro are most effective, but BotGuard will certainly mitigate medium sized attacks. Alternatively, if you wish to manually configure software on your hosting server (which is less limited compared to cloud services like Cloudflare), we recommend trying Fail2ban, Modsecurity, or Bunkerized Nginx Webserver (which includes Fail2ban and Modsecurity).</p>
<p> </p>
<h2><strong>Layer 3/4 DDoS</strong></h2>
<p>A Layer 4 DDoS attack is often referred to as a SYN flood. A TCP connection is established in what is known as a 3-way handshake. The client sends a SYN packet to the target server, the server responds with a SYN ACK, and the client responds to that with an ACK. After the three-way handshake is complete, the TCP connection is considered established. Attackers can send SYN Floods in an attempt to stop one's network from functioning properly. Layer 3 attacks often utilize the ICMP protocol which can be stopped by disabling ICMP. Layer 4 attacks are often easy to mitigate as long as you choose the right server provider. OVH provides DDoS Protection with all of their servers and has a network capacity of over 11 TBPS.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>DDoS Attacks are extremely harmful to websites, and are of course illegal. We hope you learned something useful from this post!</p>

                <p>Publicly disclosing your email address is dangerous for many reasons with the biggest reason being; by disclosing your email address, it shows what email provider you use. For example, if my Email is example@gmail.com, and I publicly disclose that email, a hacker can go to gmail.com and try to hack into my account by cracking my password or via social engineering. Your email can also end up in a bad place (ex: dangerous dark web forums), which can lead to bad things. Below, we'll be suggesting two services which allow you to create email aliases, so you can still receive emails on your email address, but your real email address won't be public.</p>
<h2><strong>Option 1: AnonAddy</strong></h2>
<div>AnonAddy lets you create your own email aliases to mask your real email address. If someone asks for your email address and you don't fully trust them, you can login to your AnonAddy account, and create a new email alias that forwards all mail sent to the email alias to your real email address. If my email alias is bob@anonaddy.me and my real email address is bobsmith@gmail.com, all mail sent to bob@anonaddy.me will be anonymously forwarded to bobsmith@gmail.com.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>TL;DR AnonAddy let's you receive emails without exposing your real email, by using email aliases. Get started for free at their website <a href="https://anonaddy.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">anonaddy.com</a></div>
<div> </div>
<h2><strong>Option 2: SimpleLogin</strong></h2>
<p>As the name suggests, SimpleLogin is very simple. SimpleLogin essentially does the same thing as AnonAddy, but as mentioned, is more simple and straight to the point. SimpleLogin is 100% open source and uses PGP Encryption (as does AnonAddy). Lastly, SimpleLogin appears to have better pricing when compared to AnonAddy, but they are both good solutions, you'll just have to choose which one you like more.<br><br>TL;DR SimpleLogin does the same thing as AnonAddy but is simpler and has better pricing.

                <p>Cryptocurrency is very popular these days. Now, the question is, how do you get cryptocurrency? Well, there are a few options, and most of the popular options have a KYC (know your customer) policy, meaning you'll need to provide your ID and the last 4 digits of your Social Security Number. You can either exchange with a company (you pay with fiat currency/USD and you receive cryptocurrency), or you'll have to find someone to trade with on the internet that already has cryptocurrency, and trust that they wont scam you.</p>
<p>If you are willing to exchange with a company (you must provide your ID &amp; SSN), we highly recommend <a href="https://coinbase.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Coinbase</a>. It is very user-friendly, fast, and simple. Binance is a very similar platform, but we have some slight concerns with their friendliness towards user privacy, which is why we will not be recommending Binance. If you would like to anonymously buy and sell Bitcoin (or other cryptocurrencies), we recommend trying out Bisq; no registration required, easy to use. Bisq is open source, and utilizes the Tor Network to give their users maximum anonymity. If you already have cryptocurrency, but would like to exchange it for a different cryptocurrency (say you have Bitcoin but want to exchange to get Ethereum), we recommend having a look at <a href="https://swapzone.io" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Swapzone</a>. We recently used Swapzone to exchange our Litecoin for Monero, and the process was seamless. No user registration is required, simply type in what you want to exchange and the amount you want to exchange, enter your email address, and boom, you can exchange, no ID verification required. The users on Swapzone are very trustworthy, and scamming would only hurt their reputation.</p>
<p>If you're looking for a central wallet for all of your cryptocurrencies, we suggest trying out Exodus. It's completely free and private, and is very user friendly. Exodus simplifies sending and receiving cryptocurrency. Exodus also has an exchange feature where you can exchange X cryptocurrency for Y cryptocurrency, but it does have high(er) fees and limits. If you're using Coinbase, then you likely don't need Exodus, as all of your cryptocurrency is already stored in your Coinbase account.</p>
<p>Cryptocurrency is a very good thing for many reasons; including user privacy, anonymity, sending money internationally, and much more.</p>

                <p>It's time to ditch Google Chrome, Opera, and Vivaldi. In this post, we're going to suggest some browsers that are great for privacy, anonymity, and security.</p>
<h2><strong>1.</strong> <strong>Firefox</strong></h2>
<p>Firefox is fast, reliable, open-source, and is focused on user privacy. With the new modernized UI along with DNS over HTTPS, you just have to try Firefox! If you're a Chrome user and want some privacy, we think you'll like the feel of Firefox. Don't forget to adjust the settings according to our recommendations:</p>
<h4>Disabling WebRTC in Firefox</h4>
<p>TL;DR Set "media.peerconnection.enabled" to "false" in "about:config".</p>
<p><strong>Explained:</strong></p>
<ol class="long-string-list">
<li>Enter "about:config" in the firefox address bar and press enter.</li>
<li>Press the button "I'll be careful, I promise!"</li>
<li>Search for "media.peerconnection.enabled"</li>
<li>Double click the entry, the column "Value" should now be "false"</li>
<li>Done. Do the <a href="https://ipleak.net/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">WebRTC leak test</a>.</li>
</ol>
<p>If you want to make sure every single WebRTC-related setting is really disabled change these settings:</p>
<ol class="long-string-list">
<li>media.peerconnection.turn.disable = true</li>
<li>media.peerconnection.use_document_iceservers = false</li>
<li>media.peerconnection.video.enabled = false</li>
<li>media.peerconnection.identity.timeout = 1</li>
</ol>
<p> </p>
<h2><strong>2. Tor Browser</strong></h2>
<p class="card-text">Tor Browser is a great choice if you need an extra layer of anonymity &amp; security. It's a modified version (fork) of Firefox, which comes with pre-installed privacy add-ons, encryption, and multiple proxy layers. The Tor Network is a network of virtual tunnels that allows you to improve your privacy and security on the Internet. Tor works by sending your web traffic through three random servers (also known as Tor relays) in the Tor network. The last relay in the circuit (the “exit relay” or "exit node") then sends the traffic out onto the public internet. You can access websites via the Tor Network by downloading the Tor Browser. Your ISP will only be able to see that you hitting a Tor Node, and nothing else. A VPN in conjunction with Tor is recommended; we recommend trying ProtonVPN or Mullvad. You're welcome to use Tor without a VPN, but then you risk the government/your ISP blocking you from accessing all safe Tor Exit Nodes, forcing you to use the government's exit node so they can inspect your traffic.</p>
<p> </p>
<h2><strong>3. Bromite</strong></h2>
<p class="card-text">Bromite is a Chromium-based browser (for Android Devices) with privacy and security enhancements, built-in adblocking and DNS over HTTPS support; it includes patches from the open source ungoogled-chromium project and other privacy-focused open source projects. If you like Google Chrome on Android, but want some more privacy, you will without a doubt love Bromite.</p>
<p>We hope this quick article helped you choose a new privacy-focused web browser, so you can take your online privacy back. Have a nice day!</p>

                <p>Whether you like it or not, your ISP is very likely spying on your every move on the internet. Most notably; Comcast, AT&amp;T, T-Mobile, and Verizon. We're going to help you stay anonymous and private, so your ISP won't be able to spy on you for any longer.</p>
<p><strong>Option 1: </strong>Use the Tor Browser</p>

<div>
<div class="card col-12">
<div class="card-wrapper">
<div class="bottom-line">
<p class="mbr-text mbr-fonts-style display-7">If you do not want to use the Tor Browser, which relays your web traffic through multiple different servers (making you anonymous) which can slow down a website's load-time a bit, you may use a standalone VPN without Tor. Using a VPN with Tor most definitely makes you more anonymous, but if your goal is to only stop your ISP from seeing what you're doing, and to hide your home IP address from websites, a standalone VPN is indeed a good idea. We recommend trying <a href="https://protonvpn.com/" class="text-primary" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ProtonVPN</a> or <a href="https://mullvad.net/" class="text-primary" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Mullvad</a>. Please ensure that your DNS resolvers on your device are not set to your ISP's DNS resolvers. If they are, change them to AdGuard DNS, BlahDNS, or Quad9 DNS.</p>

<div class="bottom-line">
<p class="mbr-text mbr-fonts-style display-7">If you're a high threat level that is in need of all internet traffic to be routed through the Tor Network, we recommend using Tails OS. This OS is a Linux Distro, based off of Debian. It routes all traffic through the Tor Network, and blocks all traffic that does not go through Tor (both in/out). As you may have guessed, Tails OS is focused on privacy and anonymity. If you are using Microsoft Windows, and for some reason cannot switch to Linux, you can either try <a href="https://www.torifier.com/index.html" class="text-primary" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Torrifier</a> or <a href="https://github.com/basil00/TorWall/releases" class="text-primary" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Tallow</a> (which both route all traffic through Tor), or you can create a Virtual Machine on your machine via VirtualBox, install Tails OS on it, and use that VM for accessing the internet.</p>

                <p>Hydrogen Aerospace is a startup France-based aerospace company. We truly like their vision, but when it comes to cybersecurity, they quite literally aren't the one. We contacted Hydrogen on October 24th, 2021, regarding critical security issues on their website. It has taken them over 24 hours to fix one of many security issues, and we have yet to receive any formal response via email. The one simple issue they have fixed involved simply modifying a file on their server that hosts their website, which, as mentioned, took them over a ridiculous 24 hours. After we sent Hydrogen an encrypted email (with the list of security issues), we heard from them on Twitter, saying "They saw your email and will take corrective actions even if a lot of what you mentioned is already done". That last part is stupidly incorrect, as we proved that the security issues were still present. They then replied to our reply on Twitter (where we asked if we can expect a response), and the reply said "The team saw your email, but will not give you update about it for security reason". This is obvious straight bullsh*t. There should be no reason as to why we cannot receive a formal response from the company stating that they received my email, they understand the severity of these security issues, they are working on fixing them, and they appreciate our report &amp; good intentions. Essentially ignoring our email (we are to assume it has been ignored or is not taken seriously seeing that we have not received a response) with a list of critical security issues that need to be solved is extremely rude and unprofessional. If they really can't give us an update via email due to "security issue", then this indicates they have another security issue affecting their email system. Hydrogen Aerospace needs to do better, act more professional, and learn to communicate properly when it comes to critical security issues that need to be solved; because so far we have only heard back from them via an unsecure privacy-violating social media platform (Twitter) where we were provided with a vague and irrational response.<br><br><strong>October 29th, 2021 Update: </strong>It's been over 6 days now and a security flaw that we reported has still yet to be fixed, and can be fixed in literally less than 5 minutes. We had to respond to the Owner (of hydrogen-aero.com) on Twitter over 5 times aggressively asking for a simple formal response (to our email) stating that they received it and that they are working on fixing the issues. All we got is a pointless delayed response saying "Thank you". Please, for your own online safety, stay away from this website with poor security.<br><br><strong>October 31st, 2021 Update: </strong>It's stupidly ridiculous how this company can't fix a very simple yet dangerous security issue. We don't promote hacking, but go ahead and exploit this issue that they refuse to fix. They are missing a DMARC record on their domain hydrogen-aero.com, so go ahead and send a forged email to whoever you want originating from <em>hi@hydrogen-aero.com</em> containing a (fake) virus link. Their website is also <strong>extremely</strong> vulnerable to the most simple DDoS attacks (HTTP Flood Attacks). OVH provides transport-level DDoS Protection, but not application-level, we're not sure if they know this or not because their website has no web application firewall (we were able to access the website via various types of bots including fake search engine bots). Hopefully this will force them to fix this issue.</p>

<p class="mbr-text mbr-fonts-style display-7">Apple is a technology company that designs and manufactures smartphones, personal computers, and more. Apple recently released a new feature that applies to all Apple devices. This new feature monitors all saved photos on your device, and constantly automatically checks them for child-abuse related material. The Center for Democracy and Technology has said that it is “deeply concerned that Apple’s changes in fact create new risks to children and all users, and mark a significant departure from long-held privacy and security protocols”. The Electronic Frontier Foundation has said that “Apple is opening the door to broader abuses”. Dr. Carmela Troncoso, a leading research expert in Security &amp; Privacy and professor at EPFL in Lausanne, Switzerland, has said that while “Apple's new detector for child sexual abuse material (CSAM) is promoted under the umbrella of child protection and privacy, it is a firm step towards prevalent surveillance and control”. Apple doesn't understand what they've done, they are just focused on selling overpriced garbage. Sure, they sell the most powerful laptop, but it's still overpriced, and the power that the laptop has is just unnecessary. Once you buy an Apple product, you fall into the Apple Trap and tell everyone how good Apple is, and then buy all of their products. Apple, you can do better. Start caring about user privacy, and the quality/price of your products.</p>
