The Tor Network does not make you completely anonymous, but definitely boosts your anonymity. The easiest way to access websites via the Tor Network is to use the official Tor Browser from torproject.org. The way Tor works is, once you go to a normal website via the Tor Browser, your connection is passed to a Tor Guard Node, which is the first server your traffic goes to. It is then passed to one or more relay servers, where your traffic is relayed from one server to another, and then is passed to the final Exit Node, which is the node that reaches out to the internet. The exit node fetches your requested content, then passes it back through the relay of servers to your machine. Tor Nodes (exit/relay/guard nodes) are mostly ran by volunteers and <strong><span class="has-inline-color has-vivid-red-color">the government</span></strong>.</p><h2><strong>Simplified Explanation:</strong></h2><p><strong>Guard Node</strong>: The first server/node that your Tor Browser connects to.</p><p><strong>Relay Node</strong>: These type of Tor Nodes are nodes that receive and pass traffic to other relay nodes. They relay your web traffic through Tor.</p><p><strong>Exit Node</strong>: The final Tor Node that your traffic reaches. The exit node is the node that actually fetches your requested content from the internet, then passes it back through all of the relay nodes and the guard node, to your machine.</p><p>Even if when you are using Tor, one of the relay nodes you are using is ran by the government, that malicious (government-ran) relay node should not be able to see what’s going on, as all traffic passed to it is encrypted, then passed to another relay node. The Tor Browser also sets a certain screen size (which is why you may see a border), and useragent, so that all people using the Tor Browser have a common fingerprint, and no users can be uniquely identified. When you visit a .onion site through Tor, there is no exit node at all, because exit nodes are gateways to the normal internet (clearnet), your traffic is passed through more relays (around 6) for increased anonymity. Tor is a very good thing, and you can even route all of your internet traffic through Tor by using Torifier, Tallow, or some other programs. The dangerous part of Tor is when you are using an exit or guard node controlled by the government. This is because, if you are connected to a Guard node that is controlled by the government, then the government will be able to see your real IP address. Most people do not recommend using Tor in conjunction with a VPN, but we do, because if the government contacts your ISP and tells them to prevent you from accessing any Tor Guard Nodes besides ones owned by the government, then the government will be able to see your IP address and the fact that you’re using Tor. With the right VPN provider (we recommend ProtonVPN or Mullvad), they will not allow the government to do such a thing, and if you happen to connect to a government-operated guard node, the government will see the VPN IP address and not your actual home IP address.</p><p>Great, so now you have a VPN on, and you’re practically safe from any malicious government-operated guard nodes, but now exit nodes are the dangerous part, because if the government is operating an exit node and your traffic goes through that exit node, then the government will be able to see what sites you are visiting, as the exit node is the only node to reach out to the internet (clearnet). To eliminate this issue, you should only be accessing onionsites, which are sites that end with .onion. You should not access any sites that use the clearnet (sites that end with .com .net .org .info etc). This is because, as we mentioned, exit nodes do not exist when connecting to onionsites, as exit nodes are the gateway to sites on the clearnet. If the exit node doesn’t exist, then absolutely no one can see what website you’re visiting besides yourself. Not even the guard node. Essentially; only use the Tor Browser (do not route your internet traffic through Tor then use Chrome), make sure you only download Tor Browser from torproject.org, use a VPN (we suggest ProtonVPN or Mullvad), and only access onionsites. This gives you a great amount of anonymity and ensures the government or any other malicious Tor Nodes cannot see what you’re doing or who you are.
