The Tor Network does not make you 100% anonymous, as that is an impossibility, but it definitely boosts your anonymity. The easiest and most safe way to access websites via the Tor Network is to use the official Tor Browser from torproject.org. The Tor Browser should only be downloaded from the official website (torproject.org).<br>The way Tor works is, once you go to a normal website via the Tor Browser, your connection is passed to a Tor Guard Node, which is the first server your traffic goes to. It is then passed to one or more relay servers, where your traffic is relayed from one server to another, and then is finally passed to the Exit Node, which is the node that reaches out to the internet. The exit node fetches your requested content, then passes it back through the relay of servers, to finally reach your machine. Tor Nodes (exit/relay/guard nodes) are mostly ran by volunteers, and <strong>sadly the government</strong>.</p><h2><strong>Simplified Explanation:</strong></h2><p><strong>Guard Node</strong>: This is the first Tor Node that your Tor Browser connects to. This is the only Tor Node that you directly connect to and the only Tor Node that can actually see your home IP address.<br><br><strong>Bridge Node: </strong>By default, you do not use a Bridge Node when using Tor. If your ISP blocks Tor Guard Nodes, and you are unable to use a VPN, then requesting Bridge Node IP's from Tor to utilize would be a good idea. Bridge Node IP Addresses are not publicly listed in a directory anywhere, so ISP's cannot block every Tor Bridge node.<br><br><strong>Relay Node</strong>: These type of Tor Nodes are nodes that receive and pass traffic to other relay nodes. They relay your web traffic from server to server. Relay Nodes cannot see your IP address, and just see the IP address of other relay nodes (or exit/guard nodes) that they are passing traffic to or are receiving traffic from.<br><br><strong>Exit Node</strong>: The final Tor Node that your web traffic/request reaches. The exit node is the node that actually fetches your requested content from the clearnet, then passes it back through all of the relay nodes and the guard node, to your machine. Exit nodes are <strong>not</strong> used when visiting a Tor Hidden Service aka Onion Site.</p><p>The Tor Browser sets a certain screen size, and useragent, so that all people using the Tor Browser have a common fingerprint, and no Tor users can be uniquely identified. You should not change any of those default settings, because by doing so, you will be de-anonymized and can be uniquely identified.<br>A large amount of ISP's block the Tor Network, and if this is the case with your ISP, you should request <a href="https://bridges.torproject.org/" class="text-primary" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Tor Bridges</a>. These type of Tor Nodes (Bridges) are essentially Guard Nodes that are not publicly listed in any online directory. You should NOT use a VPN while using the Tor Network, as a money trail is often attached. Using a VPN in conjunction with Tor in an attempt to not fall on the watchlist of your ISP or government would be almost pointless as Tor has almost 2 million daily users.<br>A more serious issue is when your Tor Circuit is using a Malicious Exit Node. Exit Nodes are the only Tor Nodes that actually reach out to the internet (clearnet) to fetch your requested web content. If the operator of the Exit Node that you are using has bad intentions, they may be able to inspect some of the web traffic sent by you, going through that Exit Node, which could de-anonymize you if you are entering sensitive information into the website you are accessing. The best way to avoid this is to never visit sites through Tor that are on the clearnet (ones ending in .com, net, org, etc), and only visit Tor Hidden Services a.k.a Onion Sites (sites that end with .onion).<br>This is because Tor Hidden Services do not utilize Exit Nodes, so it would be impossible for you to be de-anonymized due to a malicious Exit Node.</p><section id="tabs1-74" class="tabs content18 cid-sOjeVAc0wk" data-bs-version="5.1"><div class="container"><div class="row justify-content-center mt-4"><div class="col-12 col-md-12"><div class="tab-content"><div id="tabs1-74_tab3" class="tab-pane active" role="tabpanel"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-12"><p class="mbr-text mbr-fonts-style display-7">Great, so now you know what precautions to take when using the Tor Network. Essentially; only use the Tor Browser (do not route your internet traffic through Tor), make sure you only download Tor Browser from torproject.org, and try to only access Tor Hidden Services a.k.a Onion Sites rather than sites hosted on the clearnet. This gives you a great amount of anonymity and online privacy, and ensures that the government or any other malicious Tor Nodes cannot see or who you are or what you're doing. As long as you take the necessary precautions which we just talked about, you will be <em>nearly</em> fully anonymous while using Tor Browser!</p></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></section></div><footer><p class="post__last-updated">This article was updated on December 1, 2021</p><div class="post__tags-share"><aside class="post__share"></aside></div><div class="post__bio author"><div><h3 class="h6 author__name"><a href="https://swivro.net/authors/swivro/" class="invert" title="Albert A.">Albert A.</a></h3></div></div><nav class="post__nav"><div class="post__nav__prev"><a class="post__nav__link" href="https://swivro.net/comcast-a-privacy-nightmare-and-horrible-company/" rel="prev">Previous Post<h3 class="h6">Comcast; a privacy-nightmare and horrible company.</h3></a></div></nav></footer></div></article></div></main><footer class="footer"><div class="footer__copyright">Proudly hosted by <a href="https://webdock.io" target="_blank">Webdock.io</a> &copy; 2021 Swivro - All Rights Reserved</div></footer><script>window.publiiThemeMenuConfig = {
