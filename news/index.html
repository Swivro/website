                        <p>On August 5th, 2021, Apple Inc. announced new technological measures meant to apply across virtually all of its devices under the umbrella of “Expanded Protections for Children”. While child exploitation is a serious problem, and while efforts to combat it are almost unquestionably well-intentioned, Apple&rsquo;s proposal introduces a backdoor that threatens to undermine fundamental privacy protections for all users of Apple products. Apple&rsquo;s proposed technology works by continuously monitoring photos saved or shared on the user&rsquo;s iPhone, iPad, or Mac. One system detects if a certain number of objectionable photos is detected in iCloud storage and alerts the authorities. Another notifies a child&rsquo;s parents if iMessage is used to send or receive photos that a machine learning algorithm considers to contain nudity.  Because both checks are performed on the user&rsquo;s device, they have the potential to bypass any end-to-end encryption that would otherwise safeguard the user&rsquo;s privacy. (credit appleprivacyletter.com) Additionally, Apple essentially, in a way, has access to view any of your photos without you knowing.</p>
<p>This is why Swivro has signed <a href="https://appleprivacyletter.com/">https://appleprivacyletter.com/</a>.
As no good as Apple already is, it continues to get worse. Read more at appleprivacyletter.com (<a href="https://appleprivacyletter.com/">https://appleprivacyletter.com/</a>)</p>

                        <p>DraugerOS is a linux gaming OS, in fact, in our opinion, it is the best linux gaming OS. Learn more about DraugerOS at their website, accessible via DraugerOS.org. Moving on..
We&rsquo;re now happily hosting a mirror of the DraugerOS Download Repository, accessible at draugeros-ny1.swivro.net/download.draugeros.org in your web browser. This will be (at least one of) DraugerOS&rsquo;s New York Download Servers. This will, hopefully, drastically improve download speeds for DraugerOS users based in or near NYC.</p>

                        <p>As most (all) of our services &amp; brands use a light (bright/white) theme by default, we will soon begin transitioning all of them to a dark theme, so your corneas no longer burn. We will also do this to match the Swivro website, as we have changed the Swivro website to be dark themed (if you didn&rsquo;t know, it was previously light themed). Dark theme is the better theme.</p>

                        <p>You may notice that on some of our brands, products, or services (on our Brands &amp; Services page), have (LTS) marked next to them. LTS simply stands for Long Term Support. Brands/Services on our Brands &amp; Services page which are marked as LTS mean they do not plan to be abandoned (without notice), are very stable &amp; are production ready, and are good enough quality to have Long Term Support (LTS) by Swivro.
Our Brands &amp; Services which are not marked as (LTS) do not have Long Term Support and could be shut down at any time. Our Brands &amp; Services which are not marked as LTS, don&rsquo;t have LTS because it does not meet one or more of the following requirements:</p>
<ul>
<li>Deemed by Swivro to be decent quality</li>
<li>Works very well, is stable, and is production-ready</li>
<li>Is not in a testing/beta/experimental phase</li>
</ul>
<p>TL;DR our services that are NOT marked as LTS (Long Term Support) are either still in a testing phase, have plans to be shut down, aren&rsquo;t good enough quality, or lacks significant features compared to competitors. Our services that ARE marked as LTS are production-ready, work very well, and are stable, planned to have long term support &amp; updates.</p>

                        <p>Around 2 weeks ago, one of our brands/services which we currently do not publicly associate ourselves with, was experiencing major downtime due to a Protocol offensive (transport level) DDoS Attack, aka a Layer 4 DDoS Attack.
We were seeking a DDoS Protection Service. We didn&rsquo;t go with CloudFlare initially, so we were seeking alternatives. Our #1 option was Shovl.io but they are currently closed for new signups, so we later found Bytefend. Bytefend seemed interesting and reliable. We realized, that, according to their homepage, they only provide 320gbps. Whilst realizing this, we reverted to FranTech, except this time we purchased a DDoS Protected IP Address, capable of handling up to 3.5 terrabytes per second and 700 million packets per second of malicious DDoS Traffic. Later we also discovered that a team member of Bytefend, likely the Owner, had been on a popular forum called Lowendtalk. On Lowendtalk, he threatened to hold someones network offline for what seemed to be no good reason, and either way, whether he had a good reason or not, it&rsquo;s illegal to send DDoS Attacks. The owner is also happily allowing websites with the sole intention being to expose peoples personal information, to use Bytefend. According to some users on Lowendtalk, Bytefend &ldquo;limited&rdquo; is also not legally incorporated.
Bytefend, we hope you can improve and do better, but as of right now, this behaviour is unacceptable.

                        <p>We&rsquo;re introducing Nova Search, an upcoming service managed by Swivro. Nova Search is a fast privacy-respecting online search engine. Nova Search is a completely anonymous search engine, it doesn&rsquo;t track you and it doesn&rsquo;t sell your data. It is scheduled to be released at the end of this monthy, being July, or early August. The code for Nova Search is ready but we are seeking a hosting provider for Nova Search, and right now our #1 option is Microsoft&rsquo;s Azure Platform.</p>
<p>We are (likely) choosing Azure because of it&rsquo;s proven high reliability, security, and high uptime.
We&rsquo;ve been creating experimental search engines throughout 2020 &amp; 2021 but now it&rsquo;s time to create a public one, available to anyone, online. Say goodbye to Bing &amp; Google.</p>
