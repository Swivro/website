    <h1 id="title">Apple&#39;s Privacy Invasion</h1>
    
      
    <nav id="TableOfContents"></nav>
    <p>On August 5th, 2021, Apple Inc. announced new technological measures meant to apply across virtually all of its devices under the umbrella of “Expanded Protections for Children”. While child exploitation is a serious problem, and while efforts to combat it are almost unquestionably well-intentioned, Apple&rsquo;s proposal introduces a backdoor that threatens to undermine fundamental privacy protections for all users of Apple products. Apple&rsquo;s proposed technology works by continuously monitoring photos saved or shared on the user&rsquo;s iPhone, iPad, or Mac. One system detects if a certain number of objectionable photos is detected in iCloud storage and alerts the authorities. Another notifies a child&rsquo;s parents if iMessage is used to send or receive photos that a machine learning algorithm considers to contain nudity.  Because both checks are performed on the user&rsquo;s device, they have the potential to bypass any end-to-end encryption that would otherwise safeguard the user&rsquo;s privacy. (credit appleprivacyletter.com) Additionally, Apple essentially, in a way, has access to view any of your photos without you knowing. They cannot search for illegal things without looking at legal things, which in this case is a huge invasion of privacy.</p>
