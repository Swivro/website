    <p>Around 2 weeks ago, one of our brands/services which we currently do not publicly associate ourselves with, was experiencing major downtime due to a Protocol offensive (transport level) DDoS Attack, aka a Layer 4 DDoS Attack.
We were seeking a DDoS Protection Service. We didn&rsquo;t go with CloudFlare initially, so we were seeking alternatives. Our #1 option was Shovl.io but they are currently closed for new signups, so we later found Bytefend. Bytefend seemed interesting and reliable. We realized, that, according to their homepage, they only provide 320gbps. Whilst realizing this, we reverted to FranTech, except this time we purchased a DDoS Protected IP Address, capable of handling up to 3.5 terrabytes per second and 700 million packets per second of malicious DDoS Traffic. Later we also discovered that a team member of Bytefend, likely the Owner, had been on a popular forum called Lowendtalk. On Lowendtalk, he threatened to hold someones network offline for what seemed to be no good reason, and either way, whether he had a good reason or not, it&rsquo;s illegal to send DDoS Attacks. The owner is also happily allowing websites with the sole intention being to expose peoples personal information, to use Bytefend. According to some users on Lowendtalk, Bytefend &ldquo;limited&rdquo; is also not legally incorporated.
Bytefend, we hope you can improve and do better, but as of right now, this behaviour is unacceptable.
