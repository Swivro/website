      <description>DraugerOS is a linux gaming OS, in fact, in our opinion, it is the best linux gaming OS. Learn more about DraugerOS at their website, accessible via DraugerOS.org. Moving on.. We&amp;rsquo;re now happily hosting a mirror of the DraugerOS Download Repository, accessible at draugeros-ny1.swivro.net/download.draugeros.org in your web browser. This will be (at least one of) DraugerOS&amp;rsquo;s New York Download Servers. This will, hopefully, drastically improve download speeds for DraugerOS users based in or near NYC.</description>

      <title>Dark Theme Transition</title>

      <description>As most (all) of our services &amp;amp; brands use a light (bright/white) theme by default, we will soon begin transitioning all of them to a dark theme, so your corneas no longer burn. We will also do this to match the Swivro website, as we have changed the Swivro website to be dark themed (if you didn&amp;rsquo;t know, it was previously light themed). Dark theme is the better theme.</description>

      <title>What Is LTS?</title>

      <description>You may notice that on some of our brands, products, or services (on our Brands &amp;amp; Services page), have (LTS) marked next to them. LTS simply stands for Long Term Support. Brands/Services on our Brands &amp;amp; Services page which are marked as LTS mean they do not plan to be abandoned (without notice), are very stable &amp;amp; are production ready, and are good enough quality to have Long Term Support (LTS) by Swivro.</description>

      <title>Bytefend&#39;s unacceptable behaviour</title>

      <description>Around 2 weeks ago, one of our brands/services which we currently do not publicly associate ourselves with, was experiencing major downtime due to a Protocol offensive (transport level) DDoS Attack, aka a Layer 4 DDoS Attack. We were seeking a DDoS Protection Service. We didn&amp;rsquo;t go with CloudFlare initially, so we were seeking alternatives. Our #1 option was Shovl.io but they are currently closed for new signups, so we later found Bytefend.</description>

      <description>We&amp;rsquo;re introducing Nova Search, an upcoming service managed by Swivro. Nova Search is a fast privacy-respecting online search engine. Nova Search is a completely anonymous search engine, it doesn&amp;rsquo;t track you and it doesn&amp;rsquo;t sell your data. It is scheduled to be released at the end of this monthy, being July, or early August. The code for Nova Search is ready but we are seeking a hosting provider for Nova Search, and right now our #1 option is Microsoft&amp;rsquo;s Azure Platform.</description>
