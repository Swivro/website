    <p>You may notice that on some of our brands, products, or services (on our Brands &amp; Services page), have (LTS) marked next to them. LTS simply stands for Long Term Support. Brands/Services on our Brands &amp; Services page which are marked as LTS mean they do not plan to be abandoned (without notice), are very stable &amp; are production ready, and are good enough quality to have Long Term Support (LTS) by Swivro.
Our Brands &amp; Services which are not marked as (LTS) do not have Long Term Support and could be shut down at any time. Our Brands &amp; Services which are not marked as LTS, don&rsquo;t have LTS because it does not meet one or more of the following requirements:</p>
<ul>
<li>Deemed by Swivro to be decent quality</li>
<li>Works very well, is stable, and is production-ready</li>
<li>Is not in a testing/beta/experimental phase</li>
</ul>
<p>TL;DR our services that are NOT marked as LTS (Long Term Support) are either still in a testing phase, have plans to be shut down, aren&rsquo;t good enough quality, or lacks significant features compared to competitors. Our services that ARE marked as LTS are production-ready, work very well, and are stable, planned to have long term support &amp; updates.</p>
