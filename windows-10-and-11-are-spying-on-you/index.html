Though it isn't perfect, and wont block all tracking features, it definitely helps and is worth using. Check it out <a href="https://www.winprivacy.de/english-home/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>.</p><p>Thehackernews.com reports that when a user left Microsoft Windows idle for about 8 hours, the computer had tried attempting well over 5,000 mysterious connections to 93 unique IP addresses, with almost 90% of those mysterious connections leading to IP addresses owned by Microsoft. Microsoft claims that all of this data sent is encrypted, and that no personal information is sent to them, so chances are, they are probably seeing what apps you're using, how much time you spend on them, etc. In Microsoft's official article stating that Windows 11 was being released on Oct. 5th, the word "privacy" did not appear once, and they did not even remotely mention anything user privacy related. Microsoft Windows is an OS that does not care one bit about user privacy and is solely focused on making Microsoft money.</p><p>Linux is simply the best option. Don't even think of trying Apple's overpriced ugly garbage, because with the new child-abuse scanning feature your privacy is non-existent. There are thousands of Linux distros available on the internet, for you to use. To help you choose a Linux distro, we'll list some of the most popular, simple, and privacy-respecting ones below.</p><p> </p><figure class="post__image"><img loading="lazy" src="https://swivro.net/media/posts/46/1024px-Desktop_Ubuntu_20.04.png" sizes="(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 100vw" srcset="https://swivro.net/media/posts/46/responsive/1024px-Desktop_Ubuntu_20.04-xs.png 300w, https://swivro.net/media/posts/46/responsive/1024px-Desktop_Ubuntu_20.04-sm.png 480w, https://swivro.net/media/posts/46/responsive/1024px-Desktop_Ubuntu_20.04-md.png 768w" alt="" width="1024" height="576"></figure><h2>Ubuntu</h2><p>Ubuntu is <strong>an open-source operating system (OS) based on the Debian GNU/Linux distribution</strong>. Ubuntu incorporates all the features of a Unix OS with an added customizable GUI, which makes it popular in universities and research organizations. Fun fact: Ubuntu is an African word that literally means "humanity to others." Ubuntu is incredibly easy to use, has an elegant interface, and is our favorite. I am currently typing these words on Ubuntu. At the time of writing, the latest LTS (long-term-support) version of Ubuntu is 20.04. <a href="https://ubuntu.com/download/desktop" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Check out Ubuntu Desktop here</a>.</p><p> </p><figure class="post__image"><img loading="lazy" src="https://swivro.net/media/posts/46/zorin-os-15.jpg" sizes="(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 100vw" srcset="https://swivro.net/media/posts/46/responsive/zorin-os-15-xs.jpg 300w, https://swivro.net/media/posts/46/responsive/zorin-os-15-sm.jpg 480w, https://swivro.net/media/posts/46/responsive/zorin-os-15-md.jpg 768w" alt="" width="1368" height="768"></figure><h2>Zorin OS</h2><p>Zorin OS is a personal computer operating system designed and promoted for users new to Linux-based computers. One of its built-in features lets users change the interface to resemble those of Microsoft Windows or macOS. In other words, if you're used to Windows, you can customize the Zorin OS layout to be more similar to the Windows layout (as seen in the screenshot above), or you can customize it to look more similar to the macOS layout. We like Ubuntu the best, but you may like Zorin OS better. Zorin OS is free, but offers a "Pro" version with more features. <a href="https://zorin.com/os/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Check out Zorin OS here</a>.</p><p> </p><figure class="post__image"><img loading="lazy" src="https://swivro.net/media/posts/46/screenshot_03-24-2020_23-39-27-1024x576.png" sizes="(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 100vw" srcset="https://swivro.net/media/posts/46/responsive/screenshot_03-24-2020_23-39-27-1024x576-xs.png 300w, https://swivro.net/media/posts/46/responsive/screenshot_03-24-2020_23-39-27-1024x576-sm.png 480w, https://swivro.net/media/posts/46/responsive/screenshot_03-24-2020_23-39-27-1024x576-md.png 768w" alt="" width="1024" height="576"></figure><h2>DraugerOS</h2><p>Drauger OS is a Linux desktop gaming operating system. It aims to provide a platform for gamers to use where they can get great performance without sacrificing their security. Furthermore, it aims to make it easy for anyone to game, whether they use a keyboard and mouse, or some sort of controller. DraugerOS is based off of Ubuntu LTS releases and is stable, secure, and gets updates thanks to the Ubuntu repositories for 5 years (even if a given Drauger OS release is not supported for the full 5 years by Drauger OS Development itself). If you're a gamer, and you're currently using Microsoft Windows, but want some more privacy and better security, we think you'll enjoy DraugerOS. <a href="https://draugeros.org/go/download-old/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Check out DraugerOS here</a>.</p><p> </p><p>Each distro that we recommend above is unique in it's own way. Some lack features when compared to others, and some have more features. It all comes down to your personal preference. We suggest carefully reviewing the info provided above about each Linux distro, and from that, determine which distro you think would be best for you. You can also try each distro individually, and keep the one you like the most. Lastly, you can go to YouTube (or invidious if you're privacy-focused) and search for reviews on all of the distros listed above. Thanks for reading, and we hope this article helped you choose a Linux distro &amp; move away from Microsoft's nasty OS!</p></div><footer><p class="post__last-updated">This article was updated on November 2, 2021</p><div class="post__tags-share"><aside class="post__share"></aside></div><div class="post__bio author"><div><h3 class="h6 author__name"><a href="https://swivro.net/authors/swivro/" class="invert" title="Albert A.">Albert A.</a></h3></div></div><nav class="post__nav"><div class="post__nav__prev"><a class="post__nav__link" href="https://swivro.net/what-dns-resolvers-should-you-be-using/" rel="prev">Previous Post<h3 class="h6">What DNS resolvers should you be using?</h3></a></div></nav></footer></div></article></div></main><footer class="footer"><div class="footer__copyright">&copy; 2021 Swivro - All Rights Reserved</div></footer><script>window.publiiThemeMenuConfig = {
